An app that makes toggling between different lock screen securities easier.

The app allows the user to define a "Low Security" lock screen (e.g. for using the phone at home) and a "High Security" lock screen (e.g. for using the phone in a public area). With the tap of a button, the user can quickly switch between these different securities, rathering than going through the arduous process of modifying the lock screen via Settings.

## Status

Development for Android in progress.
